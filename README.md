# free_throws

This script parses play by play data I got [here](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/playbyplay-data/) and returns stats about how an individual player draws fouls and gets free throws.

Stats websites pretty much exclusively have only a single stat for this kind of data, which is free throw attempts (FTA), however I wanted to know a little more indepth where these attempts were coming from.

For example, there is general talk online (see /r/nba) that the biggest foul drawers in the league right now, almost to the point of taking advantage of the fouling rules, are James Harden, Luka Doncic, Trae Young and Damian Lillard.

I wanted to compare these players (and others) and see if they draw fouls in the same way or with the same sort of ratios.

Personally, from my own viewing of games, it's quite rare for a player to be fouled on a three point shot, but some players are notorious for getting fouled on these, such as Harden, Trae and Lillard. I wanted to check if this was actually the case or if it was confirmation bias.
